# geomancy-app

Geomancer App is a command-line tool for casting and interpreting traditional geomantic shield charts. It renders readings directly in your UTF-8 compatible terminal, combining classical symbolism with modern clarity. Interpretations are optionally enhanced through Gemini, drawing on planetary influences and age-old questions to illuminate each figureâ€™s meaning
